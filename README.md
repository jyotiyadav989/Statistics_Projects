# Project Description: Central Tendency Case-Study.
In this project, we analyzed a wine quality dataset to understand the distribution and central tendency of different acids and quality ratings. We used visualizations like histograms to see how the data is spread and calculated measures like the mean and median to summarize the data. We also identified the most common quality rating. This simple analysis helped us understand the key features of the dataset.

# Project Description: Descriptive Statistics Case-Study.
This project involves analyzing an employee dataset to explore the relationships between various features like age, salary, healthy eating, and active lifestyle. We used visualizations such as scatter plots, count plots, and histograms to understand these relationships. Additionally, we subsetted the data based on specific thresholds to identify potential discrepancies in employee compensation. The analysis revealed general trends and highlighted areas for further investigation.
