#Project Description: Central Tendency Case-Study.

In this project, we analyzed a wine quality dataset to understand the distribution and central tendency of different acids and quality ratings. We used visualizations like histograms to see how the data is spread and calculated measures like the mean and median to summarize the data. We also identified the most common quality rating. This simple analysis helped us understand the key features of the dataset.
